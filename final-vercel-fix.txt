# FINAL FIX for Vercel Deployment

# Problem: Vercel still detects pnpm-lock.yaml from previous commits
# Solution: Force npm usage with updated vercel.json and .vercelignore

# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Add all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit the final fix
git commit -m "🔧 Fix: Force npm usage for Vercel deployment

✅ Final Fix for Vercel pnpm-lock.yaml error:
- Updated vercel.json to force npm with --no-frozen-lockfile
- Added .vercelignore to ignore pnpm files
- Removed builds config that was causing issues
- Added function timeout configuration

🔧 Changes:
- vercel.json: Simplified config with npm commands
- .vercelignore: Ignore pnpm-lock.yaml and pnpm files
- Force npm install with --no-frozen-lockfile flag
- Added API function timeout (30s)

📊 Impact:
- Vercel will use npm instead of pnpm
- No more frozen-lockfile errors
- Deployment should succeed with npm
- API functions have proper timeout"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 5. Monitor Vercel deployment
echo "✅ Check Vercel dashboard - deployment should now use npm"
echo "🔍 Look for 'Running install command: npm install' in logs"
